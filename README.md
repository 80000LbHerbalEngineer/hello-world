Hello! My name is Scott Sager. I'm a old truck driver making big changes.
As far as interests go, herbal medicine is the main one for me. I'm 
currently on FreeCodeCamp having finished html basics and about to start CSS.
I was dragged kicking and screaming into emails, smartphones, and texting. 
Seriously, I can barely type! Been two-finger typing for years, but I'm 
learning! I'm touch-typing this...slowly. 

With steady, focused learning and practice, my goal is to build a PWA 
(Progressive Web App) using html, CSS, Javascript, and Vue. The focus will be
on herbal community, educational resources, and pooling resources and 
intention to create positive change.
